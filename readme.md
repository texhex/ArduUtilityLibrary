# ArduUtilityLibrary

ArduUtilityLibrary (AUL) is a library to assist the development of Arduino based programs. 

Not one electronic project I have created would have been possible without Arduino or the great open source libraries that are available for it. This library is my attempt to give something back to the Arduino community with the hope it is useful to others.  I <3 [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc).


### Documentation
The following classes or functions are included with ArduUtilityLibrary:

- [MillisDuration](docs/MillisDuration.md) - Keep track of a duration in milliseconds
- [MemoryInformation](docs/MemoryInformation.md) - Returns the size (in bytes) of different memory sections
- [availableMemory()](docs/AvailableMemory.md) - Returns the number of free memory (in bytes) 
- [halt()](docs/halt.md) - Halts the execution of your sketch permanently
- [HeartbeatLED](docs/HeartbeatLED.md) - A try to imitate the human heartbeat with a LED

Each file contains a section "References" that links to other implementations or important information about the topic. If you think my solution is bad, these links might be a good starting point to find what you are searching for.

## Usage ##
