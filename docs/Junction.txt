In order to have the \ArduUtilityLibrary folder both inside the repository and inside the \libraries folder of the Arduino IDE, I create a directory junction using MKLINK.exe. 


Param #1, Destination (Arduino IDE library folder): C:\dev\arduino-1.0.1\libraries\ArduUtilityLibrary

Param #2, the folder with the HG repository: C:\dev\Arduino\ArduUtilityLibrary\repository\ArduUtilityLibrary


Open a command prompt with Administrator rights, then execute:

mklink /J "C:\dev\arduino-1.0.1\libraries\ArduUtilityLibrary" "C:\dev\Arduino\ArduUtilityLibrary\repository\ArduUtilityLibrary"


To remove the junction, just delete the folder ArduUtilityLibrary inside the Arduino IDE folder. This will NOT delete the source folder. 

However, any file you delete inside the destination will be gone for good.
